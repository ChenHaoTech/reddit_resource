"I am a failure, hardly paying attention to whether the sun is shining brightly or not, because there is no time."

"My parents cannot provide me with support, and my education is not high. I am alone in the city, searching for my future."

"I applied for many jobs, but none of them hired me. Perhaps no one likes someone who is not good at speaking, dislikes socializing, and doesn't show enough capability."

"I only ate two pieces of bread in three whole days. Hunger kept me awake at night. Luckily, I had paid the rent for a month in advance, so I could still stay in that dark basement without having to face the unusually cold winter wind outside."

Finally, I found a job working night shifts at the hospital, guarding the morgue.

"The night in the hospital was even colder than I had imagined, the corridor lights were not on, everything was dim, and I could only see my way by the faint light seeping out from the rooms."

"The smell there was foul, with corpses being brought in occasionally and we helped move them into the morgue."

"This is not a great job, but at least it allows me to afford bread. I can also use my free time at night to study. After all, not many people are willing to come to the morgue unless there are bodies to be brought in or taken away for cremation. Of course, I don't have enough money to buy books, and I don't see any hope of saving up at the moment."

"I have to thank my former colleague. If it weren't for his sudden resignation, I might not have been able to get this job."

"I dream of being able to take turns being responsible during the day, but now I always sleep when the sun comes out, and get up after nightfall, making my body a bit weak, and my head occasionally throbs."

 One day, the movers brought in a new corpse.

 Listening to others, this is my former colleague who suddenly resigned.

"I was a little curious about him, so after everyone left, I pulled out the drawer and quietly opened the body bag."

"He is an old man, with a face that is both green and white, covered with wrinkles everywhere, looking very scary in the extremely dim light."

His hair was sparse, mostly white, all his clothes were taken off, not even a piece of fabric left on him.

"For deceased individuals without any family, the movers will certainly not miss the opportunity to make some extra money."

"I saw a strange mark on his chest, dark greenish-black in color, I can't describe the exact shape, the lighting at that time was just too dim."

 I reached out and touched the mark, nothing special.

Looking at this former colleague, I couldn't help but wonder, if I continue like this, will I end up like him when I grow old..

I told him that I would accompany him to the crematorium tomorrow, personally take his ashes to the nearest free public cemetery, so that those responsible for these matters wouldn't find it troublesome and just casually throw them into a river or a wasteland.

"This will sacrifice my morning sleep, but it's okay, Sunday is coming soon, I can make up for it."

After saying that, I prepared the body bag and stuffed it back into the cabinet.

 The light in the room seemed to dim further..

 "After that day, every time I went to sleep, I would always dream of a thick fog."

"I have a premonition that something will happen soon. I sense that sooner or later, something that may not even be called human will come looking for me. But no one is willing to believe me. They think that in such an environment and such a job, my mind has become somewhat abnormal and that I need to see a doctor..."

A male guest sitting at the bar looked towards the storyteller who had suddenly stopped

 "And then?"

The male guest was in his thirties, wearing a brown coarse woolen jacket and light yellow trousers, with flat-pressed hair, and a simple dark round hat beside him.

He looked ordinary, like most people in the tavern, with black hair, light blue eyes, neither handsome nor ugly, lacking distinctive features

In his eyes, the storyteller was a young man of eighteen or nineteen, tall and slender, with black short hair and light blue eyes that were strikingly deep-set, his features sharp and captivating.

 The young man looked at the empty wine glass in front of him and sighed, saying:

 "And then?"

 "Then I quit my job and returned to the countryside, just to come here and chat with you."

As he spoke, a smile appeared on his face, with a hint of cunning in it.

 The male guest was stunned for a moment:

 "Are you just bragging about what you said earlier?"

 "Haha." Laughter erupted around the bar counter.

The laughter subsided slightly, and a slender middle-aged man looked at the somewhat awkward guest and said:

Outsider, how could you believe Lucien's stories? He changes them every day. Yesterday, he was a poor fellow whose fiancée broke off their engagement because of his poverty, and today he's turned into a corpse watcher!

"Yes, talking about thirty years on the east side of the Serranzo River, thirty years on the right side of the Serranzo River, just nonsense!" another regular at the tavern chimed in.

They were all farmers from the large village of Koldu, wearing short jackets in black, grey, or brown.

The young man with black hair, known as Lucien, slowly stood up, leaning on the bar with both hands, and said with a smile:

"You know, these are not stories I made up, they were all written by my sister. She loves writing stories the most, she's even a columnist for 'Novel Weekly'."

After speaking, he turned his body to the side, extended his hand to the foreign guest, and smiled brightly, saying:

 "It seems she writes really well."

 "I'm sorry for the misunderstanding."

The man in the brown coarse cloth jacket, who had an ordinary appearance, did not get angry. He stood up and smiled in response:

 A very interesting story.

 "What should I call you?"

"Isn't it common sense to introduce yourself before asking others?" Lumian chuckled.

 The guest from out of town nodded:

 "My name is Ryan Cos."

 "These two are my companions, Valente and Lya."

 The following sentence refers to a man and a woman sitting next to each other.

The man, around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, had yellow hair with a touch of powder on it. His not-so-big eyes were a shade deeper than the color of lake water. He was dressed in a white vest, a blue wool coat, and black trousers. It was evident that he had put some effort into his appearance before leaving the house.

 His expression was quite indifferent, not paying much attention to the farmers and herders around him.

The woman appeared younger than the two men, with her light gray long hair intricately tied up in a bun, and a white veil wrapped around her head like a hat.

Her eyes matched her hair in color, and as she looked at Lucien, there was an undisguised smile in her gaze, finding the recent events amusing.

Under the glow of the tavern's gas wall lamp, the woman named Lya revealed a pretty nose and beautifully curved lips, making her a true beauty in a rural village like Coldu.

She was wearing a white pleated cashmere tight skirt, paired with a cream-colored jacket and a pair of Musketeer boots. There were two silver bells tied to her veil and boots, making a jingling sound as she walked into the tavern earlier, attracting a lot of attention and causing many men to stare.

In their eyes, this must be the kind of fashionable attire only seen in big cities like the provincial capital Bigor and the capital Terrel.

 Lumian nodded to the three outsiders:

 "My name is Loomian Li, you can just call me Loomian."

 "Li?" Lilia blurted out.

"What's wrong with my last name?" Lucien asked curiously.

 Ryan. Cos explained to Lilia:

"Your surname is terrifying, I almost couldn't control my voice just now."

 Seeing the puzzled faces of the farmers and herdsmen around him, he further explained:

Source Text: "接触过水手、海商的人都知道，五海之上有这样一句话流传：" Translated Text: "Those who have had contact with sailors and merchants all know that there is a saying that circulates over the five seas:"

"I would rather encounter those pirate generals or even kings, than to come across a man named Frank Lee."

 "The surname of that person is also Li."

 "Is he very scary?" Lumian asked.

 Ryan shook his head:

"I'm not sure, but since there is such a legend, it must be good."

 He dropped the subject and turned to Lucien

 "Thank you for your story, it deserves a toast, what would you like?"

"A glass of 'Green Fairy'," Lucien said without any courtesy, sitting back down.

 Ryan Cos frowned slightly and said:

 "The Green Fairy"... Absinthe?

"I think I need to remind you that wormwood is harmful to the human body, this kind of alcohol may lead to mental confusion and cause hallucinations."

"I didn't expect that the popular trend from Trier has spread here," Lilia said with a smile beside him.

 Lumian let out a soft "Oh":

 "The people of Trier also like to drink 'Absinthe'..."

"For us, life is already hard enough, there's no need to care about a little more hurt, this kind of wine can give our spirits greater relaxation."

"Alright." Ryan sat back in his seat and looked at the bartender. "A glass of 'Green Fairy' and another one of 'Spicy Heartbeat' for me."

 "The Spicy Heart" is a famous fruit liqueur.

"Why not get me a 'Green Fairy' too? I was the one who told you the truth just now, and I can tell you exactly what's going on with this kid!" The first man to expose Lucien's daily storytelling, a thin middle-aged man, complained, "Outsider, I can tell that you still doubt the truth of that story!"

"Pierre, you can really do anything for a free drink!" Lucien responded loudly.

 Without waiting for Ryan to make a decision, Lucian added:

“Why can't I tell it myself, so I can have another glass of 'Absinthe'?”

"The situation you described has left them unsure whether to believe it or not," the middle-aged man named Pierre chuckled smugly. "Your sister's favorite story to tell the children is 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf,' where it's clear that those who lie will eventually lose their credibility."

"Alright." Lucian shrugged, watching as the bartender slid a glass of pale green liquor in front of him.

 Ryan looked at him and inquired:

 "Is it possible?"

"No problem, as long as your wallet is sufficient to cover the cost of these drinks," Lucien replied nonchalantly.

 "Another glass of 'Green Fairy'," Ryan nodded.

 Pierre's face was full of smiles at that moment:

Generous outsider, this kid is the village's biggest prankster, you must stay away from him.

"Five years ago, he was brought back to the village by her sister, Aurel, and never left again. Imagine, before that, he was only thirteen years old, how could he have been a mortuary attendant at the hospital? Well, the nearest hospital to us is in Daleriz, at the foot of the mountain, a whole afternoon's journey away."

 "Take it back to the village?" Lya asked sharply.

 She tilted her head slightly, producing a tinkling sound.

 Pierre nodded:

"Aurora moved here six years ago and, after a year, she went out and brought back this kid, claiming she found him on the road, a homeless child on the brink of starvation, intending to adopt him."

"Then, he followed Auror surnamed 'Li', even the name 'Lumian' was chosen by Auror."

"I've forgotten what it was originally called." Lucien took a sip of absinthe and said with a grin.

It seems that he is not at all ashamed or embarrassed by his past being exposed like this.
